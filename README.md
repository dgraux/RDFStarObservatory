### Context: RDF\* &amp; SPARQL\*

Recently, Hartig _et al._ proposed [RDF\*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3399.pdf): a syntax to express statements of statements for [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) data without involving tedious reification methods. Furthermore, following this RDF extension, they also suggested an [extension](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1141963/FULLTEXT01.pdf) based on [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) for querying these new datasets.
